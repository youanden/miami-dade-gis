-Download shapefiles archives from the Miami-Dade Self-Service GIS: 
http://gisweb.miamidade.gov/GISSelfServices/GeographicData/MDGeographicData.html

-Convert shapefiles to geoJSON at http://shpescape.com/mix/ (upload the .zip)

-Click download. When geoJSON file opens in browser, copy its content to a .geojson file

-Once geoJSON file is pushed to Github, you can see it as a map by click on the file and then selecting the paper icon if it is not already selected.

If you have issues displaying map, use the geoJSON Linter: http://geojsonlint to test your data.
